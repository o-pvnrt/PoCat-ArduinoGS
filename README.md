## Introduction
This project aims to provide a simple Ground Station to ease development of the PoCat PockeQubes and provide easy debugging and data reception coordinated with the COMMS Subsystem. This is then an Arduino script
to control an AB01 Dev-Board (V2) to provide simple reception and transmission of data.
